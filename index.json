Here, in a two-dimensional setting, we show using a machine learning approach that both the particle radius and concentration can be accurately measured when the boundary condition on the particles is of Dirichlet type. Although the methods we introduce could be applied to any particle type. In general backscattering is challenging to interpret for a wide range of particle concentrations, because multiple scattering cannot be ignored, except in the very dilute range. Across the concentration range from 1% to 20% we find that the mean backscattered wave field is sufficient to accurately determine the concentration of particles. However, to accurately determine the particle radius, the second moment, or average intensity, of the backscattering is necessary. We are also able to determine what is the ideal frequency range to measure a broad range of particles sizes. To get rigorous results with supervised machine learning requires a large, highly precise, dataset of backscattered waves from an infinite half-space filled with particles.

Since the reference configuration is not stress-free, the effects of initial stresses on the hyperelastic behavior must be constitutively addressed. Notably, the free energy of an initially stressed material may not possess the same symmetry group as the one of the same material deforming from a naturally unstressed configuration. This work assumes that the hyperelastic strain energy density is characterized only by the deformation gradient and the initial stress tensor, using an explicit functional dependence on their independent invariants. In particular, we consider a subclass of constitutive behaviors in which the material constants do not depend on the choice of the reference configuration. Within this theoretical framework, a constitutive equation is derived for an initially stressed body that naturally behaves as an incompressible Mooney-Rivlin material. The strain energy densities for initially stressed neo-Hookean and Mooney materials are derived as special sub-cases. By assuming the existence of a virtual state that is naturally stress-free, the resulting strain energy functions are proved to fulfill the required frame-independence constraints for this special class of constitutive models. In the case of plane strain, great simplifications arise in the expression of the constitutive relations. Finally, the resulting constitutive relations prove useful guidelines for designing non-destructive methods for the quantification of the underlying initial stresses in naturally isotropic materials","tags":["Initial stress","elasticity","Residual stress","Constitutive equations","Mooney-Rivlin material"],"title":"The constitutive relations of initially stressed incompressible Mooney-Rivlin materials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Artur L.

The restriction applies to strain energy functions W  that are explicit functions of the elastic deformation gradient F and initial stress τ, that is W:=W(F,τ). The restriction is a consequence of energy conservation and ensures that the predicted stress and strain energy do not depend upon an arbitrary choice of reference configuration. We call this restriction initial stress reference independence (ISRI). It transpires that most strain energy functions found in the literature do not satisfy ISRI, and may therefore lead to unphysical behaviour, which we illustrate through a simple example. To remedy this shortcoming, we derive three strain energy functions that do satisfy the restriction. We also show that using initial strain (often from a virtual configuration) to model initial stress leads to strain energy functions that automatically satisfy ISRI. Finally, we reach the following important result: ISRI reduces the number of unknowns in the linear stress tensor for initially stressed solids. This new way of reducing the linear stress may open new pathways for the non-destructive determination of initial stresses through ultrasonic experiments, among others.","tags":["elasticity","initial stress","constitutive equations"],"title":"A new restriction for initially stressed elastic solids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Hundreds of years of experimentation has led to similar discoveries when mixing fluids and gases, what we now call complex fluids/media.\nToday composite materials and complex fluids have enabled amazing advances in areas including: aerospace, automobile, food science, communications technology, biotechnology.\n      Click on images above. Metal matrix foams and fibre composites are examples of composites, while emulsions, suspensions, complex gases, and polymers are complex fluids.\n My research focuses on waves (like sound, radio, light, and vibrations) interacting with these complex materials. Developing mathematical models of this interaction has two exciting goals:\n Controlling waves by designing the next generation of materials. These new materials can then improve telecommunications by controlling light and elastic waves, and mechanical engineering by controlling vibrations and even earthquakes. Sensing materials with waves. We sense the world around us by using waves. Light and sound are reflected from all materials, and when they reach us, our brains can decode them to understand what objects are around us. In a similar way, waves are used to sense the microstructure materials. One use is to automate manufacturing, where we need to develop sensors that can detect changes in microstructure from reflected waves. Keeping track of the microstructure is essential to determine when the material has reached its optimally flexibility, strength, or capacity to transmit information.  Mathematical models In all these complex materials, it is impossible to know the exact position and shapes of all the microstructure. But the reflected wave does depend on the configuration of the microstructure.\n    Caption: one reflected wave from a complex material. What can we learn about this material from measuring the wave at the receiver?   Caption: the wave reflected from the same complex material can be different each time if its microstructure moves, or if the position of the receiver moves. For example the grey curves above are all different reflected waves from the same material. To make sense of these curves, we investigate the average (mean: black curve) reflected wave, and the variation of the reflected waves (std: green region).\n(Figures made with wave scattering software I develop)\n Our goal is to develop mathematical models which predict the average reflected wave and its variance (or standard deviation), as these do not depend on the configuration of the microstructure. One of our discoveries [paper 1,paper 2] is that there exists many waves, with different speeds and characteristics, that can propagate (in an ensemble averaged sense) inside these complex materials.\nOnce we have accurate mathematical models, and software, we can generate a large quantity of (average) reflected waves from different material, such as shown below. This large quantity of data is essential to learn how to sense materials and design materials to control waves.\n   The average and variation of waves reflected from a variety of complex materials.

For this reason, it is useful to develop a mechanical framework of initially stressed solids irrespective of how this stress formed. An ideal way to do this is to write the free energy density Ψ in terms of initial stress τ and the elastic deformation gradient F, so we write Ψ=Ψ(F,τ). In this paper, we present a new constitutive condition for initially stressed materials, which we call the initial stress symmetry (ISS). We focus on two consequences of this condition. First, we examine how ISS restricts the possible choices of free energy densities Ψ=Ψ(F,τ) and present two examples of Ψ that satisfy the ISS. Second, we show that the initial stress can be derived from the Cauchy stress and the elastic deformation gradient. To illustrate, we take an example from biomechanics and calculate the optimal Cauchy stress within an artery subjected to internal pressure. We then use ISS to derive the optimal target residual stress for the material to achieve after remodelling, which links nicely with the notion of homeostasis.","tags":null,"title":"Initial stress symmetry and its applications in elasticity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Artur L.

However, these models present major challenges. Two of these challenges are how to combine these anisotropic invariants and how to reliably determine the model parameters from experiments. We present an intuitive way to account for both anisotropic invariants through a measure of the fibre extension and a measure of the fibre compression. We suggest that a possible remedy to help characterize a material is to use experiments that cause wrinkles to appear on the surface of the material. We call these wrinkles surface wrinkles. A soft solid will, when compressed, often develop surface wrinkles within its elastic regime, much like when we pinch our skin. Here we use the theory of elasticity to effectively model these large deformations and predict the formation of small superimposed wrinkles. Hence we work through the conditions necessary for the appearance of small surface wrinkles and apply these conditions to a simple model that uses the measures of both fibre extension and compression. It turns out that the angle between the fibres and the surface-wrinkle orientation can be used to distinguish whether the fibres resist only extension, only compression, or a mixture of both. We also uncover a striking tendency of this angle between the fibres and the wrinkle orientation to alternate between only three or four fixed quanta. This trend increases as the fibre strength is increased.","tags":["fibre-reinforced","non-linear elasticity","soft matter","wrinkles","instabilities","anisotropy"],"title":"Connecting the material parameters of soft fibre-reinforced solids with the formation of surface wrinkles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Such materials can be regarded as incompressible, and when the incompressibility condition is adopted the strain energy Ψ of the HGO model is a function of one isotropic and two anisotropic deformation invariants. A compressible form (HGO-C model) is widely used in finite element simulations whereby the isotropic part of Ψ is decoupled into volumetric and isochoric parts and the anisotropic part of Ψ is expressed in terms of isochoric invariants. Here, by using three simple deformations (pure dilatation, pure shear and uniaxial stretch), we demonstrate that the compressible HGO-C formulation does not correctly model compressible anisotropic material behaviour, because the anisotropic component of the model is insensitive to volumetric deformation due to the use of isochoric anisotropic invariants. In order to correctly model compressible anisotropic behaviour we present a modified anisotropic (MA) model, whereby the full anisotropic invariants are used, so that a volumetric anisotropic contribution is represented. The MA model correctly predicts an anisotropic response to hydrostatic tensile loading, whereby a sphere deforms into an ellipsoid. It also computes the correct anisotropic stress state for pure shear and uniaxial deformations. To look at more practical applications, we developed a finite element user-defined material subroutine for the simulation of stent deployment in a slightly compressible artery. Significantly higher stress triaxiality and arterial compliance are computed when the full anisotropic invariants are used (MA model) instead of the isochoric form (HGO-C model).","tags":[],"title":"A robust anisotropic hyperelastic formulation for the modelling of soft tissue","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Artur L Gower"],"categories":null,"content":" Summary   Estimated track in red compared with the camera image in blue.
