These stresses can arise from thermal expansion or volumetric growth, for example, in the production of the material. There are two approaches to modelling such materials that appear similar, but are, in fact, distinct. The first defines a function, $\\tilde{W}(\\mathbf{F},\\boldsymbol{\\tau})$, associated with a *fixed reference configuration*, $\\mathcal{B}$, say, where each value of $\\vec{\\tau}$ corresponds to the initial stress in a *different elastic material* that occupies $\\mathcal{B}$ (each with a different elastic constitutive equation, effectively). The second defines a function, $\\overline{W}(\\mathbf{F},\\boldsymbol{\\tau})$, associated with a *single, fixed, initially stressed, elastic material* (with a single constitutive equation), where each value of $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ represents the stress in a *different configuration* of that material. Here, we discuss why stored energy functions of the latter type, and similar functions that are written in terms of an initial *strain*, need to satisfy some restrictions to avoid unphysical behaviours. To illustrate their need, we perform an asymptotic expansion to prove that these restrictions are required for consistency with strain energy functions of classical third-order weakly nonlinear elasticity.\n","tags":["acousto-elasticity","initial stress","visco-elasticity","elastic-waves"],"title":"The elastic stored energy of initially strained, or stressed, materials: restrictions and third-order expansions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paulo S Piva","Kevish K Napal","Artur L Gower"],"categories":null,"content":"Particulate materials include powders, emulsions, composites, and many others. This is why measuring these has become important for both industry and scientific applications. For industrial applications, the greatest need is to measure dense particulates, in-situ, and non-destructively. In theory, this could be achieved with acoustics: the standard method is to send an acoustic wave through the particulate and then attempt to measure the effective wave speed and attenuation. A major obstacle here is that it is not clear how to relate the effective wave speed and attenuation to the reflection and transmission coefficients, which are far easier to measure. This is because it has been very difficult to mathematically account for different background mediums. In this paper, we resolve this obstacle. To help comprehension, we present how to account for different background mediums for a simple case: a halfspace filled with a random particulate, where the background of the halfspace is different from the exterior medium. The key to solving this problem was to derive a systematic extension of a widely used closure approximation: the quasi-crystalline approximation. We present some numerical results to demonstrate that the reflection coefficient can be easily calculated for a broad range of frequencies and particle properties.\n","date":1733082672,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733082672,"objectID":"50f16be6bcf13c51383b55c4f9812580","permalink":"https://arturgower.github.io/publication/complex-materials/xqca/","publishdate":"2024-12-01T19:51:12Z","relpermalink":"/publication/complex-materials/xqca/","section":"publication","summary":"We resolve the challenge of relating effective wave properties to measurable reflection and transmission coefficients in acoustic measurements of dense particulates by deriving a systematic extension of the quasi-crystalline approximation for halfspace materials with random particulates.","tags":["complex materials","particulates","Monte Carlo","Effective waves","homogenisation","Quasi-Crystalline Approximation"],"title":"Acoustic waves in a halfspace material filled with random particulate","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I might try and write talks in MarkDown or something mind like that\u0026hellip;\n","date":1720656000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1720656000,"objectID":"7baaf512ffea2960dea8572f12b486e0","permalink":"https://arturgower.github.io/talk/intro/","publishdate":"2024-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/intro/","section":"talk","summary":"I might try and write talks in MarkDown or something mind like that\u0026hellip;\n","tags":["talk"],"title":"Introductory talks","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I might try and write talks in MarkDown or something mind like that\u0026hellip;\n","date":1720656000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1720656000,"objectID":"7fd84d8707c07073924081cc4fb84075","permalink":"https://arturgower.github.io/talk/talk-links/","publishdate":"2024-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/talk-links/","section":"talk","summary":"I might try and write talks in MarkDown or something mind like that\u0026hellip;\n","tags":["talk"],"title":"Research talks","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"This is an example video talk demonstrating how to embed YouTube videos in your talks section.\n","date":1720656000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1720656000,"objectID":"45a0bba34cbd99b884ac55f283e25ec0","permalink":"https://arturgower.github.io/talk/ini-effective-waves/","publishdate":"2024-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ini-effective-waves/","section":"talk","summary":"How to ensemble average waves in particulate materials, including boundaries, propagation, and Quasi-Crystalline-Approximation.","tags":[],"title":"Waves in disordered particles","type":"video"},{"authors":["Kevish K Napal","Paulo S Piva","Artur L Gower"],"categories":null,"content":"When a wave, such as sound or light, scatters within a densely packed particulate, it can be rescattered many times between the particles, which is called multiple scattering. Multiple scattering can be unavoidable when trying to use sound waves to measure a dense particulate, such as a composite with reinforcing fibres. Here, we solve from first principles multiple scattering of scalar waves, including acoustic, for any frequency from a set of two-dimensional particles confined in a circular area. This case has not been solved yet, and its solution is important to perform numerical validation, as particles within a cylinder require only a finite number of particles to perform direct numerical simulations. The method we use involves ensemble averaging over particle configurations, which leads us to deduce an effective T-matrix for the whole cylinder, which can be used to easily describe the scattering from any incident wave. In the specific case when the particles are monopole scatterers, the expression of this effective T-matrix simplifies and reduces to the T-matrix of a homogeneous cylinder with an effective wavenumber⁠.

This phenomenon is not unique to microwaves; for instance, ultrasound is also disrupted when traversing through heterogeneous tissues. Understanding the average transmission in particle-filled environments is central to improve data extraction or even to create materials that can selectively block or absorb certain wave frequencies. Most methods that calculate the average transmitted field assume that it satisfies a wave equation with a complex effective wavenumber. However, recent theoretical work has predicted more than one effective wave propagating even in a material which is statistically isotropic and for scalar waves. In this work we provide the first clear evidence of these predicted multiple effective waves by using high-fidelity Monte-Carlo simulations that do not make any statistical assumptions. To achieve this, it was necessary to fill in a missing link in the theory for particulate materials: we prove that the incident wave does not propagate within the material, which is usually taken as an assumption called the Ewald–Oseen extinction theorem. By proving this we conclude that the extinction length—the distance it takes for the incident wave to be extinct—is equal to the correlation length between the particles.\n","date":1719517872,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719517872,"objectID":"d950e810154563baadaf43399124c757","permalink":"https://arturgower.github.io/publication/complex-materials/average-transmitted/","publishdate":"2024-06-27T19:51:12Z","relpermalink":"/publication/complex-materials/average-transmitted/","section":"publication","summary":"Mechanical stress in tissue is important but hard to measure.

Measuring these stresses in tissue is challenging due to the complex, and often unknown, nature of the material properties. Recently, a method called the angled shear wave identity was proposed to predict the stress by measuring the speed of two small amplitude shear waves. The method does not require prior knowledge of the material’s constitutive law, making it ideal for complex biological tissues. We extend this method, and the underlying identity, to include viscous dissipation, which can be significant for biological tissues. To generalise the identity, we consider soft viscoelastic solids described by a generalised Newtonian viscous stress, and account for transverse isotropy, a feature that is common in muscle tissue, for instance. We then derive the dispersion relationship for small-amplitude shear waves superimposed on a large static deformation. Similarly to the elastic case, the identity is recovered when the stress in the material is coaxial with the transverse anisotropy. A key result in this paper is that to predict the stress in a viscous material one would need to measure the wave attenuation as well as the wave speed. The case of viscoelastic materials with memory is also discussed.\n","date":1716839472,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716839472,"objectID":"550a74e52f950f5111d1e3bc72eba27c","permalink":"https://arturgower.github.io/publication/nonlinear-elasticity/universal-angled-shear/","publishdate":"2024-05-27T19:51:12Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nonlinear-elasticity/universal-angled-shear/","section":"publication","summary":"Mechanical stress in tissue is important but hard to measure.

Many theoretical methods require the pair-correlation to predict material properties such as fluid flow, thermal properties, or wave propagation. In all these applications it is either important to calculate a pair-correlation from specific particle configurations, or vice-versa: determine the likely particle configurations from a pair-correlation which is needed to fabricate a particulate material.

In general backscattering is challenging to interpret for a wide range of particle concentrations, because multiple scattering cannot be ignored, except in the very dilute range. Across the concentration range from 1% to 20% we find that the mean backscattered wave field is sufficient to accurately determine the concentration of particles. However, to accurately determine the particle radius, the second moment, or average intensity, of the backscattering is necessary. We are also able to determine what is the ideal frequency range to measure a broad range of particles sizes. To get rigorous results with supervised machine learning requires a large, highly precise, dataset of backscattered waves from an infinite half-space filled with particles.

Since the reference configuration is not stress-free, the effects of initial stresses on the hyperelastic behavior must be constitutively addressed. Notably, the free energy of an initially stressed material may not possess the same symmetry group as the one of the same material deforming from a naturally unstressed configuration. This work assumes that the hyperelastic strain energy density is characterized only by the deformation gradient and the initial stress tensor, using an explicit functional dependence on their independent invariants. In particular, we consider a subclass of constitutive behaviors in which the material constants do not depend on the choice of the reference configuration. Within this theoretical framework, a constitutive equation is derived for an initially stressed body that naturally behaves as an incompressible Mooney-Rivlin material. The strain energy densities for initially stressed neo-Hookean and Mooney materials are derived as special sub-cases. By assuming the existence of a virtual state that is naturally stress-free, the resulting strain energy functions are proved to fulfill the required frame-independence constraints for this special class of constitutive models. In the case of plane strain, great simplifications arise in the expression of the constitutive relations.

The restriction applies to strain energy functions W  that are explicit functions of the elastic deformation gradient F and initial stress τ, that is W:=W(F,τ). The restriction is a consequence of energy conservation and ensures that the predicted stress and strain energy do not depend upon an arbitrary choice of reference configuration. We call this restriction initial stress reference independence (ISRI). It transpires that most strain energy functions found in the literature do not satisfy ISRI, and may therefore lead to unphysical behaviour, which we illustrate through a simple example. To remedy this shortcoming, we derive three strain energy functions that do satisfy the restriction. We also show that using initial strain (often from a virtual configuration) to model initial stress leads to strain energy functions that automatically satisfy ISRI. Finally, we reach the following important result: ISRI reduces the number of unknowns in the linear stress tensor for initially stressed solids.

Metal matrix foams and fibre composites are examples of composites, while emulsions, suspensions, complex gases, and polymers are complex fluids.\nMy research focuses on waves (like sound, radio, light, and vibrations) interacting with these complex materials. Developing mathematical models of this interaction has two exciting goals:\nControlling waves by designing the next generation of materials. These new materials can then improve telecommunications by controlling light and elastic waves, and mechanical engineering by controlling vibrations and even earthquakes. Sensing materials with waves. We sense the world around us by using waves. Light and sound are reflected from all materials, and when they reach us, our brains can decode them to understand what objects are around us. In a similar way, waves are used to sense the microstructure materials. One use is to automate manufacturing, where we need to develop sensors that can detect changes in microstructure from reflected waves. Keeping track of the microstructure is essential to determine when the material has reached its optimally flexibility, strength, or capacity to transmit information. Mathematical models In all these complex materials, it is impossible to know the exact position and shapes of all the microstructure. But the reflected wave does depend on the configuration of the microstructure.\nCaption: one reflected wave from a complex material. What can we learn about this material from measuring the wave at the receiver? Caption: the wave reflected from the same complex material can be different each time if its microstructure moves, or if the position of the receiver moves. For example the grey curves above are all different reflected waves from the same material. To make sense of these curves, we investigate the average (mean: black curve) reflected wave, and the variation of the reflected waves (std: green region).\n(Figures made with wave scattering software I develop)\nOur goal is to develop mathematical models which predict the average reflected wave and its variance (or standard deviation), as these do not depend on the configuration of the microstructure. One of our discoveries [paper 1,paper 2] is that there exists many waves, with different speeds and characteristics, that can propagate (in an ensemble averaged sense) inside these complex materials.\nOnce we have accurate mathematical models, and software, we can generate a large quantity of (average) reflected waves from different material, such as shown below.

For this reason, it is useful to develop a mechanical framework of initially stressed solids irrespective of how this stress formed. An ideal way to do this is to write the free energy density Ψ in terms of initial stress τ and the elastic deformation gradient F, so we write Ψ=Ψ(F,τ). In this paper, we present a new constitutive condition for initially stressed materials, which we call the initial stress symmetry (ISS). We focus on two consequences of this condition. First, we examine how ISS restricts the possible choices of free energy densities Ψ=Ψ(F,τ) and present two examples of Ψ that satisfy the ISS. Second, we show that the initial stress can be derived from the Cauchy stress and the elastic deformation gradient. To illustrate, we take an example from biomechanics and calculate the optimal Cauchy stress within an artery subjected to internal pressure.

However, these models present major challenges. Two of these challenges are how to combine these anisotropic invariants and how to reliably determine the model parameters from experiments. We present an intuitive way to account for both anisotropic invariants through a measure of the fibre extension and a measure of the fibre compression. We suggest that a possible remedy to help characterize a material is to use experiments that cause wrinkles to appear on the surface of the material. We call these wrinkles surface wrinkles. A soft solid will, when compressed, often develop surface wrinkles within its elastic regime, much like when we pinch our skin. Here we use the theory of elasticity to effectively model these large deformations and predict the formation of small superimposed wrinkles. Hence we work through the conditions necessary for the appearance of small surface wrinkles and apply these conditions to a simple model that uses the measures of both fibre extension and compression. It turns out that the angle between the fibres and the surface-wrinkle orientation can be used to distinguish whether the fibres resist only extension, only compression, or a mixture of both. We also uncover a striking tendency of this angle between the fibres and the wrinkle orientation to alternate between only three or four fixed quanta. This trend increases as the fibre strength is increased.","tags":["fibre-reinforced","non-linear elasticity","soft matter","wrinkles","instabilities","anisotropy"],"title":"Connecting the material parameters of soft fibre-reinforced solids with the formation of surface wrinkles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Modelling soft tissues has an immense potential to impact healthcare. It will enable a revolution of simulated surgeries, and long term predictions of prosthetics in the human body. Most soft tissues are reinforced by fibres (anisotropic). In this paper, we demonstrated how to implement, in finite element, robust models of anisotropic soft tissues. We were the first to correctly model volumetric changes in soft tissues, which, previously, were ignored by most finite element methods. To demonstrate the importance of our method, we simulated a stent deployed in an artery, and showed how the arterial forces were significantly under predicted with previous models.\n","date":1417106086,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417106086,"objectID":"dfc99d93f7cd5c36b295951b2900ddf8","permalink":"https://arturgower.github.io/publication/nonlinear-elasticity/robust-anisotropy/","publishdate":"2014-11-27T16:34:46Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nonlinear-elasticity/robust-anisotropy/","section":"publication","summary":"The Holzapfel–Gasser–Ogden (HGO) model for anisotropic hyperelastic behaviour of collagen fibre reinforced materials was initially developed to describe the elastic properties of arterial tissue, but is now used extensively for modelling a variety of soft biological tissues. Such materials can be regarded as incompressible, and when the incompressibility condition is adopted the strain energy Ψ of the HGO model is a function of one isotropic and two anisotropic deformation invariants. A compressible form (HGO-C model) is widely used in finite element simulations whereby the isotropic part of Ψ is decoupled into volumetric and isochoric parts and the anisotropic part of Ψ is expressed in terms of isochoric invariants. Here, by using three simple deformations (pure dilatation, pure shear and uniaxial stretch), we demonstrate that the compressible HGO-C formulation does not correctly model compressible anisotropic material behaviour, because the anisotropic component of the model is insensitive to volumetric deformation due to the use of isochoric anisotropic invariants. In order to correctly model compressible anisotropic behaviour we present a modified anisotropic (MA) model, whereby the full anisotropic invariants are used, so that a volumetric anisotropic contribution is represented. The MA model correctly predicts an anisotropic response to hydrostatic tensile loading, whereby a sphere deforms into an ellipsoid. It also computes the correct anisotropic stress state for pure shear and uniaxial deformations. To look at more practical applications, we developed a finite element user-defined material subroutine for the simulation of stent deployment in a slightly compressible artery. Significantly higher stress triaxiality and arterial compliance are computed when the full anisotropic invariants are used (MA model) instead of the isochoric form (HGO-C model).","tags":[],"title":"A robust anisotropic hyperelastic formulation for the modelling of soft tissue","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Artur L Gower"],"categories":null,"content":"Summary Estimated track in red compared with the camera image in blue.

Our first paper on the theme \u0026hellip;\nUltrasonics Ultrasonics, and elastic waves, are ideal to monitor and measure materials soft and hard. Elastic waves travel through materials without altering their properties, and are sensitive to changes in mechanical properties. The complexity of elastic waves has benefits and drawbacks.\nBenefits: their complexity makes them versatile, allowing them to travel over great distances as a compact signal, or sweep wide areas quickly along surfaces and interfaces. Drawbacks: accurate interpretation of ultrasonic waves requires the use of mathematical models, signal processing techniques, and computer codes, which can be time-consuming. The motivations to work on ultrasonics include:\nNon-destructive testing. Ultrasonic methods are commonly used in non-destructive testing (NDT) applications, such as inspecting welds, detecting cracks in materials, and evaluating the integrity of structures. Mathematical models can help us develop new NDT methods that are more accurate, efficient, and reliable, by predicting how ultrasonic waves behave in different materials and under different conditions.\nMedical applications. A technique called shear wave elastography uses a standard ultrasound machine (with a high frame-rate) to produce and visualise elastic shear waves propagating in soft tissue. We use mathematical models to understand what these shear waves can tell us, and how best to generate these shear waves.\nBelow we discuss some examples.\nPoint impact on a surface When an anisotropic solid is hit at one point, the solid will react by sending waves out in all directions.
