      <description>Materials comprising randomly distributed particles, or inclusions, occur frequently in the world around us. Common examples include composites, emulsions, suspensions, complex gases, etc&amp;hellip; This paper is the first to clearly prove that, contrary to the belief of most in the community, multiple effective waves propagate in particulate materials (in an ensemble-average sense).</description>

      <title>Multiple Waves Propagate in Random Particulate Materials</title>

      <description>To the right of the dashed line are particles, whose position has been numerically ensemble averaged. To the left is just a homogenious medium. What is shown here (though faintly) is that more than one transmitted wave exists in an ensemble averaged medium. The paper shows this with much more clarity!</description>

      <title>Reflection from a multi-species material and its transmitted effective wavenumber</title>

      <description>Particulate materials (emulsions, powders, blood) have led to significant advances in foods science and healthcare. To automate the production of these materials or to monitor them in use, waves such as acoustics and light are essential. One open challenge has been to describe waves in particles with different sizes and properties (multi-species). These variations in particle properties are key indicators of performance. This paper is the first to derive a rigorous model, and demonstrates the deficiencies of current ad hoc models.</description>

      <title>The constitutive relations of initially stressed incompressible Mooney-Rivlin materials</title>

      <description> Illustrates how the virtual stress-free state relates to a formulation purely in terms of stress tensors. B0 is virtual stress-free state, B1 is the initially stressed configuration with internal stress τ, and B2 is the current configuration with Cauchy stress σ.   </description>

      <title>A new restriction for initially stressed elastic solids</title>

      <description>  This is from an example that illustrates that even uniaxial deformations lead to unphysical results, if our restriction is not satisfied.   </description>

      <title>Oblique Wrinkles</title>

      <description>The wrinkles do not always align in the direction of greatest stress or aligned with the fibres.   Soft solids, such as silicon, rubber, soft tissues, can undergo large strains and compression. During compression, a wrinkle can form on the material&amp;rsquo;s surface. These wrinkles are used to, for example: create microlens arrays, tune surface wetting and adhesion. Alternatively, they can be undesirable.
Guided by physical intuition, it was thought that wrinkles always form orthogonal to the direction of greatest compression.</description>

      <title>Morphology of residually stressed tubular tissues: Beyond the elastic multiplicative decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/tube-morphology/</link>

      <description>Illustrates the kind of wrinkling instabilities that appear for different distributions of residual stress. These studies can help explain the morphology of tubular structures. For a growing tissue, like our intestine, to form a specific type of wrinkle, it need only generate the right kind of stress, then the tube will spontaneously wrinkle.   Mammal physiology has an incredible range of patterns, from the folded structure of brains, to the wrinkles along intestines.</description>

      <title>Initial stress symmetry and its applications in elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/stress-symmetry-2015/</link>

      <description>Stresses in solids can arise due to an external load, or from internal changes such as thermal expansion and growth. Significant residual stress are present in biological tissues due to growth, in most metal due to cooling and rolling, and even in the earths crust due to gravity and active tectonics. These stresses greatly alter the elastic behaviour of a solid, which is the theme of this work. This paper demonstrated that a basic physical law (related to energy conservation) was missing from all the elastic models in the field.</description>

      <title>Connecting the material parameters of soft fibre-reinforced solids with the formation of surface wrinkles</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/fibre-wrinkle/</link>

      <description>Summary When we compress a soft solid enough, it will form wrinkles on its surface, as shown by the figure below.
 When a soft solid is sheared enough, it will form wrinkles on its surface. The black lines show the directions of reinforcing fibres.   Most biological materials (and industrial) are reinforced with stiff fibres. Knowing how these wrinkles form
 will give us greater control when creating textured surfaces.</description>

      <description>Contour plots illustrating the stresses computed for the standard arterial wall model (HGO-C) and our modified model (MA) after stent deployment. A) von Mises stress q, B) pressure stress -σ hyd, C) triaxiality, D) ratio of axial stress to the circumferential stress σ_zz /σ_θθ.   Modelling soft tissues has an immense potential to impact healthcare. It will enable a revolution of simulated surgeries, and long term predictions of prosthetics in the human body.</description>

      <title>Counter-intuitive results in acousto-elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/acousto-elasticity/</link>

      <description>A plane surface wave travelling on the top of a deformed soft solid.   Highlights:
 We revisit the theory of acousto-elasticity in deformed isotropic solids. Intuition suggests that slowest and the fastest waves should travel along the directions of least and greatest stretch. We find examples where this is not the case, for body and for surface waves. These results complicate accepted protocols for finding the directions of greatest strains.</description>

      <title>Shear instability in skin tissue</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/skin-shear/</link>

      <description>On the left the skin at rest, on the right we shear the skin until wrinkles form. What can these wrinkles tell us about the skin?   We explore how the alignment of surface wrinkles relate to the directions of the reinforcing fibres in the skin. This technique is used to estimate the Langer lines (directions of greatest tension), which then indicates where incisions are best made for surgery.</description>
