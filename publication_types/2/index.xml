      <title>Multiple Waves Propagate in Random Particulate Materials</title>

      <description>To the right of the dashed line are particles, whose position has been numerically ensemble averaged. To the left is just a homogenious medium. What is shown here (though faintly) is that more than one transmitted wave exists in an ensemble averaged medium. The paper shows this with much more clarity!</description>

      <title>The constitutive relations of initially stressed incompressible Mooney-Rivlin materials</title>

      <description>   Illustrates how the virtual stress-free state relates to a formulation purely in terms of stress tensors. B0 is virtual stress-free state, B1 is the initially stressed configuration with internal stress τ, and B2 is the current configuration with Cauchy stress σ.   </description>

      <description>    This is from an example that illustrates that even uniaxial deformations lead to unphysical results, if our restriction is not satisfied.   </description>

      <description>   The wrinkles do not always align in the direction of greatest stress or aligned with the fibres.   </description>

      <title>Morphology of residually stressed tubular tissues: Beyond the elastic multiplicative decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/tube-morphology/</link>

      <description>   Illustrates the kind of wrinkling instabilities that appear for different distributions of residual stress. These studies can help explain the morphology of tubular structures. For a growing tissue, like our intestine, to form a specific type of wrinkle, it need only generate the right kind of stress, then the tube will spontaneously wrinkle.   </description>

      <description>   Illustrates a Wapa tree that explodes when cut, because it is releasing a tremendous amount of residual stress.   </description>

      <title>Connecting the material parameters of soft fibre-reinforced solids with the formation of surface wrinkles</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/fibre-wrinkle/</link>

      <description>Summary When we compress a soft solid enough, it will form wrinkles on its surface, as shown by the figure below.   When a soft solid is sheared enough, it will form wrinkles on its surface. The black lines show the directions of reinforcing fibres.   Most biological materials (and industrial) are reinforced with stiff fibres. Knowing how these wrinkles form
 will give us greater control when creating textured surfaces.</description>

      <title>Counter-intuitive results in acousto-elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/acousto-elasticity/</link>

      <description>A plane surface wave travelling on the top of a deformed soft solid.   Highlights:
 We revisit the theory of acousto-elasticity in deformed isotropic solids. Intuition suggests that slowest and the fastest waves should travel along the directions of least and greatest stretch. We find examples where this is not the case, for body and for surface waves. These results complicate accepted protocols for finding the directions of greatest strains.</description>

      <title>Shear instability in skin tissue</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/skin-shear/</link>

      <description>On the left the skin at rest, on the right we shear the skin until wrinkles form. What can these wrinkles tell us about the skin?   We explore how the alignment of surface wrinkles relate to the directions of the reinforcing fibres in the skin. This technique is used to estimate the Langer lines (directions of greatest tension), which then indicates where incisions are best made for surgery.</description>
