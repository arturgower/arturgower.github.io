&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most biological materials (and industrial) are reinforced with stiff fibres or are under tension. I figure out how these mechanisms influence elastic surface waves and the formation of surface wrinkles. The main reasons to do this are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will give us greater control over surface waves or forming textured surfaces (using surface wrinkles).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use these surface waves and surface wrinkles to measure biological materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;point-impact-on-a-surface&#34;&gt;Point impact on a surface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an anisotropic solid is hit at one point, the solid will react by sending waves out in all directions. Because the solid is anisotropic, these waves travel at different speeds in different directions, which creates unique patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;alignright&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://arturgower.github.io/img/WaveFront.jpeg&#34; data-caption=&#34;illustrates how to calculate the surface wave front (red), after one second, from the surface wave speed (green). That is, the length of v is equal to the speed of the surface wave travelling in the v direction. The blue shading shows how overlapping plane waves form the wave front.&#34;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work I have done on plane surface waves can be used to predict the result of these point impacts, among other applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oblique Wrinkles</title>

Justification Statement: the originality, significance and rigour of this output (up to 100 words).
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soft solids, such as silicon, rubber, soft tissues, can undergo large strains and compression. During compression, a wrinkle can form on the material&amp;rsquo;s surface. These wrinkles are used to, for example: create microlens arrays, tune surface wetting and adhesion. Alternatively, they can be undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guided by physical intuition, it was thought that wrinkles always form orthogonal to the direction of greatest compression. In this paper, we demonstrate that wrinkles at different angles (oblique) can supersede all other wrinkles, according to the theory of nonlinear elasticity. This affects both how early wrinkles form and their pattern. However, our table top experiments with gelatin do not confirm these findings. We go to show that a non-oblique creases may supersede our oblique wrinkles. Till today, the competition between creases and wrinkles is still an unresolved issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Factual information about the significance of the output

This oblique wrinkle work led to this paper and to an Irish Research Council Postgraduate Scholarship (GOIPG/2013/260) - 46k euro.

How wrinkles form underpins many techniques across science and engineering, see examples below. All these methods rely on an intuitive assumption: that wrinkles form orthogonal to the directions of greatest tension. Our work demonstrates that rigours theory does not confirm this assumption.

 Examples include:
- use surface wrinkles to tune surface wetting and adhesion.
- to pattern microlens array (used in fibre optics and optical computing), to create wavy stretchable electronics which can undergo large strains without breaking.   
- avoiding wrinkling in flexible displays and eletro-textiles.  

Reviewers quotes:
- I learned a number of new things from this paper ... The occurrence of wrinkles
that are aligned obliquely as revealed by the authors was unexpected to me.
- A very original paper, clearly written and containing pertinent informations.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image above shows the story of a wave propagating in a sphere, like a planet, travelling through both time t and space R (distance from origin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wave is an elastic wave with radial symmetry, so we can imagine this as a wave created from the centre of the earth. The colour indicates the amplitude of the wave, with yellow-ish corresponding to no wave. In this image the wave begins at 1km from the centre of the earth, R=1, at time t=0. As time progressing, we climb up through the vertical axis, and the wave splits into two: one heading to the centre of the earth of the other racing towards the surface. The wave that heads to the centre focuses its energy, as space becomes limited, and eventual &amp;ldquo;collides with the origin&amp;rdquo; and then reflects back towards the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The mechanics of soft solids</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Most of my work on elastic solids has been on constitutive equations, that is, mathematically describing the different components of a solid, and how these effect the forces and deformations. With the two main themes being stressed solids and fibre-reinforced solids. I have also explored how to use waves and instabilities to characterise solids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;initially-stressed-solids&#34;&gt;Initially stressed solids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driving question is how to mathematically describe the mechanical response of residually stressed solids? Our main contribution has been revealing a new symmetry, a result from conservation of energy, that restricts the possible mechanical responses.&lt;/p&gt;
