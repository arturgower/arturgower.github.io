  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://arturgower.github.io/img/multiple-waves-diagram.png&#34; data-caption=&#34;Caption: When an incident plane wave $\mathrm e^{i \mathbf k \cdot (x,y)}$ with $\mathbf k = k(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$, encounters an (ensemble-averaged) particulate material, it excites many transmitted plane waves and one reflected plane wave. The transmitted waves are of the form $\mathrm e^{i \mathbf s_p \cdot (x,y)}$ with wavenumbers $\mathbf s_p = S_p (\cos \theta_p, \sin \theta_p)$ (details in paper) where both $S_p$ and $\theta_p$ are complex numbers. The larger Im $\mathbf s_p$, the more quickly the wave attenuates as it propagates into the half-space and the smaller the drawn vector for that wave above.&#34;&gt;

      <title>Multiple Waves Propagate in Random Particulate Materials</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the right of the dashed line are particles, whose position has been numerically ensemble averaged. To the left is just a homogenious medium. What is shown here (though faintly) is that more than one transmitted wave exists in an ensemble averaged medium. The paper shows this with much more clarity!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflection from a multi-species material and its transmitted effective wavenumber</title>

Justification Statement: the originality, significance and rigour of this output (up to 100 words).
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulate materials (emulsions, powders, blood) have led to significant advances in foods science and healthcare. To automate the production of these materials or to monitor them in use, waves such as acoustics and light are essential. One open challenge has been to describe waves in particles with different sizes and properties (multi-species). These variations in particle properties are key indicators of performance. This paper is the first to derive a rigorous model, and demonstrates the deficiencies of current ad hoc models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Factual information about the significance of the output --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting the British Standards (ISO 20998-3:2017): &amp;ldquo;Ultrasonic spectroscopy is widely used to measure particle size distribution (PSD) in colloids, dispersions, and emulsions&amp;rdquo;. Yet, despite the widespread use and importance of these methods, the ISO publication describes that there does not exist a rigorous model for acoustics in polydisperse particles (multi-species). This paper clearly fills this gap in the knowledge, and provides simply accessible formulas, as well a software package (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/arturgower/EffectiveWaves.jl&#34;&gt;https://github.com/arturgower/EffectiveWaves.jl&lt;/a&gt;) for a vast range of different particle materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
Reviewers:
- This extension to the multi-species case is non-trivial and leads to some counter-intuitive results.
- This paper ... makes original and worthwhile extensions of knowledge.
