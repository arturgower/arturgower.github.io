      <title>An ultrasonic method to measure stress without calibration: The angled shear wave method</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/angled-ultrasonic-stress/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Measuring stress levels in loaded structures is crucial to assess and monitor structure health and to predict the length of remaining structural life. Many ultrasonic methods are able to accurately predict in-plane stresses inside a controlled laboratory environment but struggle to be robust outside, in a real-world setting. That is because these methods rely either on knowing beforehand the material constants (which are difficult to acquire) or require significant calibration for each specimen. This paper presents an ultrasonic method to evaluate the in-plane stress in situ directly, without knowing any material constants. The method is simple in principle, as it only requires measuring the speed of two angled shear waves. It is based on a formula that is exact for incompressible solids, such as soft gels or tissues, and is approximately true for compressible hard solids, such as steel and other metals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soft solids, such as silicon, rubber, soft tissues, can undergo large strains and compression. During compression, a wrinkle can form on the material&amp;rsquo;s surface. These wrinkles are used to, for example: create microlens arrays, tune surface wetting and adhesion. Alternatively, they can be undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guided by physical intuition, it was thought that wrinkles always form orthogonal to the direction of greatest compression. In this paper, we demonstrate that wrinkles at different angles (oblique) can supersede all other wrinkles, according to the theory of nonlinear elasticity. This affects both how early wrinkles form and their pattern. However, our table top experiments with gelatin do not confirm these findings. We go to show that a non-oblique creases may supersede our oblique wrinkles. Till today, the competition between creases and wrinkles is still an unresolved issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Factual information about the significance of the output

This oblique wrinkle work led to this paper and to an Irish Research Council Postgraduate Scholarship (GOIPG/2013/260) - 46k euro.

How wrinkles form underpins many techniques across science and engineering, see examples below. All these methods rely on an intuitive assumption: that wrinkles form orthogonal to the directions of greatest tension. Our work demonstrates that rigours theory does not confirm this assumption.

 Examples include:
- use surface wrinkles to tune surface wetting and adhesion.
- to pattern microlens array (used in fibre optics and optical computing), to create wavy stretchable electronics which can undergo large strains without breaking.   
- avoiding wrinkling in flexible displays and eletro-textiles.  

Reviewers quotes:
- I learned a number of new things from this paper ... The occurrence of wrinkles
that are aligned obliquely as revealed by the authors was unexpected to me.
- A very original paper, clearly written and containing pertinent informations.

      <title>Morphology of residually stressed tubular tissues: Beyond the elastic multiplicative decomposition</title>

&lt;p&gt;Mammal physiology has an incredible range of patterns, from the folded structure of brains, to the wrinkles along intestines. How do these patterns emerge, and what do they tell us about the mechanics of these tissues? These patterns often result from mechanical instabilities, and previous studies were able to predict a variety of patterns from simple scenarios, such as increasing pressure in a tube. However, these previous studies needed to make use of an abstract construct, a virtual state that the material never occupies. In this paper, we our the first to show that a large variety of tissue patterns can be predicted by simply altering the internal stresses. This clear connection between internal stresses and patterning allows us to clearly connect the tissue&amp;rsquo;s mechanical function and properties to its pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Factual information about the significance of the output

This paper was the first to demonstrate how internals stress can be directly related to pattern formation (through instabilities). A range of papers on pattern formation in soft tissues have resulted from this work, including:
- patterns formation on elastic spheres (like the early stage of an embryo) due to internal stresses.
- wrinkles forming on stressed thin films (used in flexible electronics and surface patterning).
- pattern formation on layered aorta (a large artery).
- theoretical frameworks which connect tissue growth, internal stress, with pattern formation.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image above shows the story of a wave propagating in a sphere, like a planet, travelling through both time t and space R (distance from origin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wave is an elastic wave with radial symmetry, so we can imagine this as a wave created from the centre of the earth. The colour indicates the amplitude of the wave, with yellow-ish corresponding to no wave. In this image the wave begins at 1km from the centre of the earth, R=1, at time t=0. As time progressing, we climb up through the vertical axis, and the wave splits into two: one heading to the centre of the earth of the other racing towards the surface. The wave that heads to the centre focuses its energy, as space becomes limited, and eventual &amp;ldquo;collides with the origin&amp;rdquo; and then reflects back towards the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The mechanics of soft solids</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/project/elasticity/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Our research focuses primarily on the study of elastic solids and the development of constitutive equations that describe the various components of these materials and their impact on forces and deformations. My work primarily centres on two main themes: stressed solids and fibre-reinforced solids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to constitutive equations, we also explore the use of waves and instabilities to characterise elastic solids and understand the origin of patterns in soft tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;initially-stressed-solids&#34;&gt;Initially stressed solids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driving question is how to mathematically describe the mechanical response of residually stressed solids? Our main contribution has been revealing a new symmetry, a result from conservation of energy, that restricts the possible mechanical responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;alignright&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://arturgower.github.io/img/gifs/ball.gif&#34; data-caption=&#34;This is what happens when you cut a residually stressed elastic rubber ball. The movement is powered by the release of the residual stress.&#34;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;instability-patterns&#34;&gt;instability patterns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most biological materials (and industrial) are reinforced with stiff fibres or are under tension. I figure out how these mechanisms influence elastic surface waves and the formation of surface wrinkles. The main reasons to do this are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will give us greater control over surface waves or forming textured surfaces (using surface wrinkles).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use these surface waves and surface wrinkles to measure biological materials.&lt;/li&gt;
