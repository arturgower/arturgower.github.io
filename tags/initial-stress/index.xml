      <title>Noninvasive measurement of local stress inside soft materials with programmed shear waves</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mechanical stresses across different length scales play a fundamental role in understanding biological systems&amp;rsquo; functions and engineering soft machines and devices. However, it is challenging to noninvasively probe local mechanical stresses in situ, particularly when the mechanical properties are unknown. We propose an acoustoelastic imaging-based method to infer the local stresses in soft materials by measuring the speeds of shear waves induced by custom-programmed acoustic radiation force. Using an ultrasound transducer to excite and track the shear waves remotely, we demonstrate the application of the method by imaging uniaxial and bending stresses in an isotropic hydrogel and the passive uniaxial stress in a skeletal muscle. These measurements were all done without the knowledge of the constitutive parameters of the materials. The experiments indicate that our method will find broad applications, ranging from health monitoring of soft structures and machines to diagnosing diseases that alter stresses in soft tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An ultrasonic method to measure stress without calibration: The angled shear wave method</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/angled-ultrasonic-stress/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Measuring stress levels in loaded structures is crucial to assess and monitor structure health and to predict the length of remaining structural life. Many ultrasonic methods are able to accurately predict in-plane stresses inside a controlled laboratory environment but struggle to be robust outside, in a real-world setting. That is because these methods rely either on knowing beforehand the material constants (which are difficult to acquire) or require significant calibration for each specimen. This paper presents an ultrasonic method to evaluate the in-plane stress in situ directly, without knowing any material constants. The method is simple in principle, as it only requires measuring the speed of two angled shear waves. It is based on a formula that is exact for incompressible solids, such as soft gels or tissues, and is approximately true for compressible hard solids, such as steel and other metals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The mechanics of soft solids</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/project/elasticity/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Our research focuses primarily on the study of elastic solids and the development of constitutive equations that describe the various components of these materials and their impact on forces and deformations. My work primarily centres on two main themes: stressed solids and fibre-reinforced solids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to constitutive equations, we also explore the use of waves and instabilities to characterise elastic solids and understand the origin of patterns in soft tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;initially-stressed-solids&#34;&gt;Initially stressed solids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driving question is how to mathematically describe the mechanical response of residually stressed solids? Our main contribution has been revealing a new symmetry, a result from conservation of energy, that restricts the possible mechanical responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;alignright&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://arturgower.github.io/img/gifs/ball.gif&#34; data-caption=&#34;This is what happens when you cut a residually stressed elastic rubber ball. The movement is powered by the release of the residual stress.&#34;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;instability-patterns&#34;&gt;instability patterns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most biological materials (and industrial) are reinforced with stiff fibres or are under tension. I figure out how these mechanisms influence elastic surface waves and the formation of surface wrinkles. The main reasons to do this are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will give us greater control over surface waves or forming textured surfaces (using surface wrinkles).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use these surface waves and surface wrinkles to measure biological materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
