      <description> Illustrates how the virtual stress-free state relates to a formulation purely in terms of stress tensors. B0 is virtual stress-free state, B1 is the initially stressed configuration with internal stress τ, and B2 is the current configuration with Cauchy stress σ.   </description>

      <title>Optimal Cable Positioning</title>

      <description>Summary A subsea control umbilical is a collection of electrical, fibre optic cables, and fluid conduits bound together. In offshore oil and gas field developments, umbilicals are critical so they need to be robust and flexible.
There is not limit to the number of possible designs that the cables can occupy, so it is not possible to just check them all. Instead, we need to allow, mathematically, these cables to be placed any where as long as they do not overlap or break any other given restriction.</description>

      <description>Summary   Estimated track in red compared with the camera image in blue. As the train shakes, so does the camera.   --  To increase the number of trains running on each track we have to be able to accurately locate every train, at each moment. GPS can be unreliable because of the multitude of tunnels, so we looked at using a camera mounted on top of the train pointed down at the tracks.</description>
