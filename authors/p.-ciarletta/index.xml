      <title>A new restriction for initially stressed elastic solids</title>

      <description>  This is from an example that illustrates that even uniaxial deformations lead to unphysical results, if our restriction is not satisfied.   </description>

      <title>Morphology of residually stressed tubular tissues: Beyond the elastic multiplicative decomposition</title>

      <description>Illustrates the kind of wrinkling instabilities that appear for different distributions of residual stress. These studies can help explain the morphology of tubular structures. For a growing tissue, like our intestine, to form a specific type of wrinkle, it need only generate the right kind of stress, then the tube will spontaneously wrinkle.   Mammal physiology has an incredible range of patterns, from the folded structure of brains, to the wrinkles along intestines.</description>

      <title>On residual stresses and homeostasis: an elastic theory of functional adaptation in living matter</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/homeostasis-stress/</link>

      <description> Illustrates a Wapa tree that explodes when cut, because it is releasing a tremendous amount of residual stress.   </description>

      <title>Initial stress symmetry and its applications in elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/stress-symmetry-2015/</link>

      <description>Stresses in solids can arise due to an external load, or from internal changes such as thermal expansion and growth. Significant residual stress are present in biological tissues due to growth, in most metal due to cooling and rolling, and even in the earths crust due to gravity and active tectonics. These stresses greatly alter the elastic behaviour of a solid, which is the theme of this work. This paper demonstrated that a basic physical law (related to energy conservation) was missing from all the elastic models in the field.</description>

      <title>Shear instability in skin tissue</title>
      <link>https://arturgower.github.io/publication/skin-shear/</link>

      <description>On the left the skin at rest, on the right we shear the skin until wrinkles form. What can these wrinkles tell us about the skin?   We explore how the alignment of surface wrinkles relate to the directions of the reinforcing fibres in the skin. This technique is used to estimate the Langer lines (directions of greatest tension), which then indicates where incisions are best made for surgery.</description>
