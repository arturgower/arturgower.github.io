Justification Statement: the originality, significance and rigour of this output (up to 100 words).
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modelling soft tissues has an immense potential to impact healthcare. It will enable a revolution of simulated surgeries, and long term predictions of prosthetics in the human body. Most soft tissues are reinforced by fibres (anisotropic). In this paper, we demonstrated how to implement, in finite element, robust models of anisotropic soft tissues. We were the first to correctly model volumetric changes in soft tissues, which, previously, were ignored by most finite element methods. To demonstrate the importance of our method, we simulated a stent deployed in an artery, and showed how the arterial forces were significantly under predicted with previous models.&lt;/p&gt;

 Some
 contributions that our method led to include
- robust simulations of arteries walls in numerous papers including: studying passive and active behaviour, optimising stent deployment, modelling the mechanics of plaque formation, and models for vein reconstruction surgeries (from venous valve tissue).
- improved models of tendons and ligaments in knees and other joints, which help optimise surgical methods, and avoid tears.
- models of the elastic behaviour of skin tissues.
- mechano-electrochemical models for smooth muscle contraction.
