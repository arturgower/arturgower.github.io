      <title>Detecting faults on a wing</title>

      <description>Below is the outline of a wing with a bolt and two plates (green) that were not fitted together correctly (may require zooming in). The method we devised takes an imprecise measurement of this wing (blue) and returns an approximation of the wing (red), see Figure 1. The method also identifies the location and type of features (i.e. the bolt and misaligned plates).
 The figures bellow (The spiky light blue image) illustrates how the method decomposes the measured data into a feature basis, much like a frequency decomposition.</description>

      <title>Tracking train tracks</title>

      <description>Estimated track in red compared with the camera image in blue. As the train shakes, so does the camera.   --  To increase the number of trains running on each track we have to be able to accurately locate every train, at each moment. GPS can be unreliable because of the multitude of tunnels, so we looked at using a camera mounted on top of the train pointed down at the tracks.</description>

      <title>The art of cable arranging</title>

      <description>How to design a collection of cables to be both robust and flexible? A subsea control umbilical is a collection of electrical, fibre optic cables, and fluid conduits bound together. In offshore oil and gas field developments, umbilicals are critical so they need to be robust and flexible.
There is not limit to the number of possible designs that the cables can occupy, so it is not possible to just check them all.</description>
